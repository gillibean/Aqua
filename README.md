Control of water filtration system
My name is Casper.
I am a total newby at programming.
I am highly qualified and skilled in multiple technical fields and easily design systems using electrical/mechanical hardware for control.
Except for Arduino tutorials I have only written one sketch before, to monitor a gas flame in a gas oven.
I am trying to write a sketch to control a water filtration.
I have already designed and tested an equivalent set up using timers, relays etc. but I would like to change over to using an arduino uno controller.
Right now I am just trying to download the RTC libraries, but I ended up getting stuck in this domain.
HELP!
